# Day 1: Data Types

**Objetive:**
Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video! 

**Task**
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d and sare already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String. 
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
   1. aaa
   2. bbb
   3. ccc

**Note:** The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, and the inputString variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

**Input Format**

A single line of text denoting inputString (the variable whose contents must be printed).

**Output Format**

Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of inputString on the second line.

**Sample Input**

| Welcome to 30 Days of Code! |
|--|

**Sample Output**

| Hello, World.  |
|---|
| Welcome to 30 Days of Code! |



**Explanation**
On the first line, we print the string literal Hello, World.. On the second line, we print the contents of the inputString variable which, for this sample case, happens to be Welcome to 30 Days of Code!. If you do not print the variable's contents to stdout, you will not pass the hidden test case.
